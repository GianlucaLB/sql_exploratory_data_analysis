Product Report
===============================================================================

Purpose:
    Consolidates key product metrics and behaviors.

Highlights:
    1. Gathers essential fields such as product name, category, subcategory, and cost.
    2. Segments products by revenue to identify High-Performers, Mid-Range, or Low-Performers.
    3. Aggregates product-level metrics:
         - total orders
         - total sales
         - total quantity sold
         - total customers (unique)
         - lifespan (in months)
    4. Calculates valuable KPIs:
         - recency (months since last sale)
         - average order revenue (AOR)
         - average monthly revenue
