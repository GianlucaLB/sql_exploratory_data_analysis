🧠 SQL Data Analytics Project

A curated collection of SQL scripts for data exploration, analytics, and reporting.
This repository showcases practical SQL examples that demonstrate how to analyze, segment, and interpret data across different business scenarios.

The scripts include:

-Database exploration – understanding structures, relationships, and key entities
-Performance metrics – calculating KPIs and aggregated measures
-Time-based analysis – identifying trends and seasonality
-Cumulative analytics – tracking growth and progress over time
-Segmentation – grouping customers, products, or transactions based on behaviors

Designed for data analysts, BI developers, and anyone looking to sharpen their SQL analytics skills, each script highlights best practices for writing clean, efficient, and insightful queries.
